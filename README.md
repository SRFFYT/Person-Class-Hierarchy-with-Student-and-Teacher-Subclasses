Person Class Hierarchy

A simple JavaScript application demonstrating object-oriented programming with ES6 classes. It features a Person base class with name and age properties and two subclasses, Student and Teacher, which extend Person to include specialized properties (grade for Student, subject for Teacher) and override the displayInfo method to show complete details.

Features
Inheritance: Student and Teacher inherit from Person, reusing its properties and methods.
Method Overriding: Subclasses customize the displayInfo method to include their specific properties.
Demonstration: Creates instances of Student and Teacher, logging their details to the console.
